*Steven Brooks, last update August 30th, 2018*
## Overview
This short Python 3 script reads in an input text (.txt) file and outputs a text (.txt) file that contains all words in the input text, sorted, along with the number of occurrences of each word. Note that words are delimited by any non-alphanumeric character, i.e. "it's" will be counted as "it" and "s". This conforms to the test cases provided by the instructor.

## Running Instructions
To run the script, simply download or clone the repository and run the wordCount.py script using `python3`. For example:

`python3 wordCount.py exampleInput.txt exampleOutput.txt`

Note that the program will overwrite the passed output file if it already exists.
